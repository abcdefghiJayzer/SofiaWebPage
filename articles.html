              Banaue Rice Terraces at Risk from Climate Change and Tourism Shift

            <p>
              The Banaue Rice Terraces, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of
              the Philippines' most iconic landscapes, are under threat from
              climate change and the shift of locals to tourism jobs. According
              to a National Geographic report (2024), the terraces are at risk
              of collapse due to erratic weather patterns, soil erosion, and the
              abandonment of traditional farming practices. The terraces, often
              called the "Eighth Wonder of the World," have been cultivated for
              over 2,000 years by the Ifugao people. However, younger
              generations are increasingly leaving farming for more lucrative
              tourism jobs, leading to the neglect of the terraces. Rosie Frost
              (2023) highlighed that while tourism provides economic
              opportunities, it also poses risks to the terraces' preservation.
              Efforts are underway to promote sustainable tourism and encourage
              locals to return to farming. Organizations are working with the
              Ifugao community to implement adaptive strategies, such as
              reforestation and the use of traditional farming techniques, to
              ensure the terraces' survival for future generations.

            <h1>Vigan Heritage Building Restoration After 2022 Earthquake</h1>
            <p>December 15, 2023</p>
            <img src="images/article2.jpg" alt="Vigan Heritage Building" />
            <p>
              The historic city of Vigan, a UNESCO World Heritage Site known for
              its well-preserved Spanish colonial architecture, suffered
              significant damage during the July 2022 earthquake. According to
              Edgar Sembrano (2022), several heritage buildings, including the
              iconic Vigan Cathedral and ancestral houses, were affected.
              Restoration efforts are ongoing, with local authorities and
              heritage advocates working to preserve the city's historical
              integrity. The process involves careful documentation, the use of
              traditional materials, and collaboration with international
              conservation experts. The restoration of Vigan is seen as a model
              for other heritage sites facing similar challenges.

            <p>
              The Benguet Center, a modernist architectural gem in Baguio City,
              was demolished in 2020 to make way for a shopping mall, sparking
              outrage among heritage advocates. Designed by National Artist for
              Architecture Leandro Locsin, the building was a symbol of post-war
              Filipino modernism and a testament to Locsin's innovative design
              philosophy. According to The Urban Roamer (2020), the Benguet
              Center was one of Locsin's lesser-known but significant works.
              Completed in the 1970s, the building featured a unique design that
              blended modernist principles with the natural landscape of Baguio.
              Its demolition was met with criticism from heritage advocates, who
              argued that the building's cultural and historical value was
              overlooked in favor of commercial development. The loss of the
              Benguet Center highlights the ongoing struggle to protect
              modernist architectural heritage in the Philippines. Advocates are
              calling for stronger enforcement of heritage protection laws and
              greater public awareness of the importance of preserving such
              structures.

              The Jai Alai Building, once a symbol of Manila's vibrant cultural
              scene, was demolished in 2000 despite its architectural and
              historical value. Designed by Welton Becket, the building was a
              prime example of Art Deco architecture in the Philippines. Edgar
              Sembrano (2025) reflected on the loss of this cultural landmark,
              which hosted sports events, concerts, and social gatherings during
              its heyday. The demolition of the Jai Alai Building remains a
              stark reminder of the challenges faced by heritage
              conservationists in the Philippines.

              The Hospicio de San Jose Building in Binondo, Manila, a historic
              structure with deep cultural roots, was allowed to be demolished
              by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP).
              The building, which served as an orphanage and hospital during the
              Spanish colonial period, was a significant part of Manila's
              history. Writer Sembrano (2020) reports that the decision sparked
              debates about the balance between development and heritage
              preservation. Many questioned the criteria used to determine a
              building's historical value, as the Hospicio de San Jose was not
              declared a heritage site despite its cultural significance.

              A Spanish-era cemetery in Balaoan, La Union, was demolished in

              period, was a significant historical site that reflected the
              region's cultural and religious history. Southeast Asian
              Archaeology (2019) reports that the destruction of the cemetery
              highlights the ongoing struggle to protect lesser-known heritage
              sites in the Philippines. Advocates are calling for stronger
              enforcement of heritage laws to prevent similar losses in the

            <p>
              The Sta. Cruz Building, once a proud symbol of Manila‚Äôs rich
              architectural history, has been demolished, marking another loss
              in the struggle to preserve the city‚Äôs cultural heritage. Built in
              the early 20th century, this Neoclassical structure was a
              prominent feature of Manila‚Äôs bustling commercial district,
              reflecting the city‚Äôs vibrant past. Despite its historical
              significance, the Sta. Cruz Building fell victim to urban
              development pressures. According Rossete Adel(2022), the building
              was torn down to make way for modern commercial projects, a fate
              shared by many of Manila‚Äôs heritage structures. The demolition has
              sparked outrage among heritage advocates, who argue that the loss
              of such buildings erases important chapters of the city‚Äôs history.
              The Sta. Cruz Building‚Äôs demolition highlights the ongoing
              challenges of heritage conservation in the Philippines. Weak
              enforcement of heritage laws, lack of public awareness, and the
              prioritization of commercial interests over cultural preservation
              have made it difficult to save historic structures. Advocates
              continue to call for stronger policies and community involvement
              to protect Manila‚Äôs remaining heritage sites. The loss of the Sta.
              Cruz Building serves as a stark reminder of the urgent need to
              balance development with heritage conservation. As Manila
              continues to modernize, the question remains: how many more
              historic landmarks will be lost before meaningful action is taken?

            <img src="images/article8.jpg" alt="Comfort Women Statue" />
            <p>
              The disappearance of the 'Comfort Women' statue in Manila has
              sparked outrage, reigniting debates about Japan‚Äôs wartime legacy
              and the Philippines‚Äô commitment to historical memory. Erected in
              2017, the statue honored the thousands of women forced into sexual
              slavery by the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II.
              According to Ang See (2021), the statue‚Äôs removal is linked to
              diplomatic pressures from Japan, which has long sought to downplay
              its wartime actions. Human rights groups and survivors‚Äô advocates,
              including Lila Pilipina, condemned the act as a betrayal of the
              victims‚Äô struggle for justice. The controversy highlights the
              tension between preserving historical truth and maintaining
              diplomatic ties. Critics argue that the removal prioritizes
              Japan‚Äôs interests over the recognition of wartime atrocities. The
              missing statue serves as a reminder of the ongoing fight for
              justice and memory. Advocates are calling for its reinstatement
              and greater efforts to educate future generations about this dark
              chapter in history.

              According to Ines (2023) the San Ignacio Church in Intramuros,
              Manila was once a stunning example of Filipino-Spanish
              architecture. Now lies in ruins after being destroyed during World
              War II. Built in the late 19th century, the church was known for
              its intricate wooden interiors and Baroque design. Despite its
              historical significance, the site has not been fully restored.
              Heritage advocates, including the Intramuros Administration, have
              called for its reconstruction to revive a piece of Manila's lost
              history. However, funding and logistical challenges have delayed
              the project. The ruins serve as a poignant reminder of the
              cultural losses suffered during the war.

              The Manila Metropolitan Theater, a National Cultural Treasure, has
              undergone a long and challenging restoration process. Built in
              1931, the theater was a thriving cultural hub during its heyday,
              hosting operas, plays, and concerts. However, it fell into
              disrepair in the latter half of the 20th century. In 2018, the
              National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA) began
              restoration efforts, aiming to bring the Art Deco masterpiece back
              to its former glory. While progress has been made, funding and
              maintenance remain ongoing challenges. The theater's revival
              symbolizes hope for the preservation of Manila's cultural

              Cera. The organ features 902 bamboo pipes, alongside some metal
              pipes, and is considered a masterpiece of both musical and
              engineering innovation. Its construction reflects the
              resourcefulness of Filipino craftsmen, who utilized locally
              available materials to create an instrument of exceptional quality
              and sound. The church itself is a fine example of Spanish colonial
              architecture, with its adobe walls and intricate wooden details.
              Over the years, the Bamboo Organ has undergone several
              restorations to preserve its unique sound and structure. Today, it
              remains a centerpiece of cultural and religious events, including
              the annual International Bamboo Organ Festival, which attracts
              musicians and visitors from around the world. Despite its
              resilience, the Bamboo Organ Church faces challenges from
              environmental factors and urbanization. The Las Pi√±as City
              Government and local heritage groups have implemented measures to
              protect the site, including regular maintenance and community-led
              conservation efforts. The Bamboo Organ Church stands as a
              testament to Filipino ingenuity and the enduring legacy of the
              country‚Äôs cultural heritage. Its preservation is a reminder of the
              importance of safeguarding unique historical treasures for future
              generations.

              Sta. Mesa Fire Station: Heritage Advocates Push for Reconstruction
            </h1>

            <p>
              The Sta. Mesa Fire Station, a 104-year-old heritage structure in
              Manila, has become the center of a heated debate between heritage
              conservationists and government agencies. The fire station, one of
              the oldest in the Philippines, was slated for demolition to make
              way for a modern facility. However, after public outcry, the
              Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP) National Capital Region (NCR)
              announced it would reconsider its plans. According to the
              Philippine Star (2024), the BFP initially proposed demolishing the
              fire station to construct a new building that would better serve
              the community‚Äôs needs. However, heritage advocates argued that the
              fire station‚Äôs historical and architectural value makes it worth
              preserving. The structure, built in 1920, is a rare example of
              early 20th-century American colonial architecture in Manila. In
              response to the backlash, the BFP-NCR stated that it is open to
              exploring alternatives, such as adaptive reuse, where the historic
              structure could be integrated into the new facility. This approach
              would allow the fire station to retain its heritage value while
              meeting modern operational requirements. The Sta. Mesa Fire
              Station case highlights the ongoing tension between development
              and heritage conservation in the Philippines. Advocates hope that
              this reconsideration will set a precedent for preserving other
              historic structures facing similar threats.
